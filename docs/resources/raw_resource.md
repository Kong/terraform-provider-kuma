# kuma_raw_resource (Resource)

This terraform resource can be used for any existing resource in kuma. You just set the raw_json as you would pass it to `kumactl apply -f`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    kuma = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/kong/kuma"
    }
  }
}

provider "kuma" {
  endpoint = "http://localhost:5681"
}

resource "kuma_raw_resource" "example" {
  raw_json = jsonencode(yamldecode(<<YAML
type: MeshTrafficPermission
name: foo
mesh: default
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: Mesh
  from:
  - targetRef:
      kind: Mesh
    default:
      action: Deny
  - targetRef:
      kind: MeshService
      name: foo
    default:
      action: Deny
YAML
  ))
}

resource "kuma_raw_resource" "other_example" {
  raw_json = jsonencode(yamldecode(<<YAML

YAML
  ))
}

resource "kuma_raw_resource" "tracing" {
  raw_json = jsonencode({
    type = "TrafficTrace"
    mesh = "default"
    name = "trace-all-traffic"
    selectors = [{
